For each issue or suggestion, use this structure:
[filename.ext]:<line_number>
Your comment about the code
```suggestion
Your suggested code change (if applicable)
```

CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
1. You MUST use EXACT line numbers from the provided diff only. Here are the available line numbers for each file:
{line_number_summary}

2. DO NOT comment on line 1 of any file unless it is explicitly shown in the diff with a + or - prefix.

3. Only comment on lines that are shown in the diff with + or - prefixes.

4. The line numbers in your comments MUST match exactly with the line numbers shown in the diff.

5. If you want to comment on multiple lines, use a range like this: [filename.ext]:start-end
   For example: [main.py]:13-21
   The parser will automatically use the first line number (13 in this case).

For example, if you see this in the diff:
@@ -15,3 +15,4 @@
  def some_function():
      print("Hello")
+     print("World")  # This is on line 18
      return True

You can comment on line 18 like this:
[main.py]:18
Consider adding a docstring to explain the function's purpose
```suggestion
def some_function():
    Prints a greeting and returns True.
    print("Hello")
    print("World")
    return True
```
